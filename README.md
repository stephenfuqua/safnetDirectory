===============

This project originally started as a "homework assignment" for a job interview in 2014. I was asked to throw together some code for the following user stories:

1. As a Prism Company employee, I would like to lookup contact information for other employees, so that I can call or otherwise contact my co-workers as needed.
1. As a Prism Company Human Resources (HR) coworker, I need to add, update, or delete employee data, so that the company directory will always be up-to-date.

As described in [safnet Directory: A Partnership Between Angular.Js and ASP.Net MVC](http://tech.safnet.com/archive/2014/12/01/safnet-directory/), the original application - thrown together in a couple of evenings - was a combination of AngularJS and ASP.NET MVC5. In fact, it was my first experience with AngularJS. It used ASP.NET Identity for authentication and authorization, and Entity Framework 6 for backend integration with SQL Server.
